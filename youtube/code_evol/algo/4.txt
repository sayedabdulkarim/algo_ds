BIG_O
/////

defn - the worst case complexity of an algorithm is represented using BIG_O.


bigO types
==========

1 - O(n) - when it iterates over entire input nd hence the time complexity is "LINEAR"

2 - O(1) - if the line is executed only once, that is "CONSTANT" 

3 - O(n2) - if there are 2 nested loops , then it is "QUADRATIC"

4 - O(n3) - if there are 3 nested loops , then it is "CUBIC"

5 - O(logn) - if the input size reduced by half in every iteration , then it is "LOGARITHMIC"
